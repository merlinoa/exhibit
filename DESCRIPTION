Description: The exhibit package is designed for making it easier to create actuarial
    reports.  exhibit takes output from functions commonly used by actuaries
    (e.g. functions in the ChainLadder package) and provides a default way
    of summarizing the function output as a dataframe or matrix that can easily be
    used to create a table in a pdf or html report.
